# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict house prices based on property features such as location, area, construction status, RERA approval, number of bedrooms, and other property characteristics.

The goal is to help buyers and real estate professionals estimate property prices using historical housing data.

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a regression-based machine learning system that accurately predicts:

**TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)**

using available house attributes.

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training
- Model comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment using Streamlit
